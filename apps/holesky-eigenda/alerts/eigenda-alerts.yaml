            Number of signed batches are not increasing. Take a look at logs and see if you are signing.
            If your node is not receiving any traffic, then you might not be signing.
            You may want to check https://blobs-holesky.eigenda.xyz/ to see if there are confirmed blobs.
            If yes, then you are missing out from serving these batches.
            Please check the runbook for further debugging.
